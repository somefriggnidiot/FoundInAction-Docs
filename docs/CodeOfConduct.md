The Found in Action Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Found in Action's values into practice. It is built around the idea that we shall continuously strive to do better and be better in all aspects of life while bringing people together through video games. Please take the time to read the Code and follow it in both spirit and letter. If you ever have a question or believe that any member, staff, or guest may be falling short of this commitment, please let us hear from you.
## Who must follow our Code?
We expect all members of Found in Action to know and follow the Code, regardless of their position or tenure with the commuity. Addionally while the Code of Conduct is written specifically for members of Found in Action, it is expected that all guests and event attendees follow the Code during their time with us.
## What if I have a question or concern?
Please let us hear from you! You are encouraged to escalate your concerns directly to community staff through a @Community Moderator  or a @Community Manager. If you feel your concerns are best handled anonymously, you may use our contact/feedback form instead.
# Community Values
## Respect
Intentionally chosen as the first value of our community, we expect all to be respectful of others. Acknowledge differences with reason and an open mind; it is required to show tolerance and consideration to one another and our guests. While there are bound to be disagreements, the presence of respect prevents their escalation into an argument.

We do not accept blatantly aggressive, discriminatory, or provocative behavior.
## Integrity
First and foremost, we do not condone hacking or cheating in any games. However, integrity isn't just about cheating. We expect our members and guests to be truthful and straightforward. In addition to cheating, behaviors such as scamming, luring unsuspecting players into dangerous situations in games, or other deceptive practices will not be tolerated. We want to foster an honest, ethical community, and will strive to remove those who undermine that ideal.
## Maturity
While we don't generally have an age requirement for our members or guests, we do require a certain level of maturity. Cursing, screaming, "raging," spamming, and general obnoxiousness should be limited in most situations. 
###  No-Drama Policy
At the end of the day, we're all just here to have fun in a game. While we recognize that life (and even games) aren't perfect, we endeavor to maintain a positive environment for each other and our guests. For this reason, we ask that you avoid bringing up controversial topics in large group settings, including religion and politics.

We also understand that not everybody can always get along. While disagreements are bound to happen, do not let them spill out into public settings. Community staff are more than happy to address your concerns privately, as doing so allows a more focused discussion and a more efficient resolution.
### Conduct Over Voice
When using voice chats, please continue to be mindful of those around. Whenever possible, use push-to-talk as your method of transmitting voice. Disruptive behaviors such as excessive yelling, background noise, mumbling self-narratives, overuse of soundboards/effects, and "second-hand audio" may result in disciplinary action or people avoiding you.
# Staff Expectations
As the leaders of the community, our staff are held to a higher standard in both behavior and activity. The position of staff signifies an additional committment to the clan and its mission.
## Activity
Staff are expected to maintain activity within the community by engaging on our social platforms and playing publically with members of the community. Inactivity on the community's official social platform(s) for greater than thirty (30) days, as defined by the greater of either the date of their last message or the date they were last seen online, may result in removal of their status as staff.
## Trust
"Staff Trust" is the idea that our members, guests, and other staff should be able to trust our staff to act when necessary, to the appropriate extent, and with the proper procedures. This trust is built through fairness and professionalism, and lost when lacking transparency and communication. It is important to us that our staff can be trusted. 
## Moderation
All moderation actions taken by staff must be done in a fair and impartial manner. Moderations against members should always be reported in a general staff channel, including the action, target, and reason, to ensure impartiality and transparency. Using a moderation action against a user should always be justified either on the content being removed, or in a general staff channel. Failure to do so at the time the action was taken may be seen as a breach of Staff Trust.
