# TLDR
Clan is split into staff (Admin or higher) and members (General or lower.) Staff is further split into High Council (Deputy Owners and Owners) and Low Council (Admin thru Overseer). Staff are supposed to track points, run events, and keep the citadel in working order. High Council is supposed to make the Low Council's life easier in any way possible and maintain the documents while still doing staff stuff.
