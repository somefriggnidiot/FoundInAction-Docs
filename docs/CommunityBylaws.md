### Subsection B - Managers
Focused on ensuring Moderators work together seamlessly between themselves and the community, Managers help keep tabs on activity across the community and its games, and provide feedback on how best to allocate resources and meet goals. Managers are the go-between for Directors and Moderators, providing policy and appointment recommendations to Directors, and ensuring goals are met by Moderators.
### Subsection C - Moderators
Moderators are tasked with day-to-day responsibilities, such as ensuring the Code of Conduct is upheld, and maintaining Community activity and engagement. They are the front-line and prime example of the community, embodying the behavior expected within the community.
